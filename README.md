# Seven_Segment_Display-ECE273-Project1-
The first objective of this project is to take a BCD input and display the corresponding decimal number on the seven-segment display. <br>
The second object involves having two control inputs that control the output on the seven-segment display per a table. <br> <br>
Files available are:<br>
  1) Pdf report that conatins all of the below,and more, along with the procedure <br>
  2) PlanAhead Generated Physical constraints <br>
  3) Test bench code to test a few sample example <br>
  4) Main binary file(.bit) that is then flashed onto board for Demo <br>
  5) Pictures of the main schematic and waveforms <br> 
  6) Module that demostrates architectural functionality of a seven segment display <br> <br>
  _Note that all labs are required to have an example test bench and waveforms to display theoretical sucess along with a demo to demonstrate actaul success_
